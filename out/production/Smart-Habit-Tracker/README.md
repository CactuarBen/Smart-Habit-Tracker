# Smart-Habit-Tracker
A project for the IU University 

The idea for this project appeared when i was trying to find a common ground for making a project that will be a good project to present for the end-result of the subject course, and as well as keep learning both Java and Python. Therefore the primary stack for it is going to be Java Spring Boot, React and FastAPI. Later on this README and the stack will be expanded once the need arises.

The goal of the project is to create a habit tracker that will gameify the experience, collect statistics and help build habits.
